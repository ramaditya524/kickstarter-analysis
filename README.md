# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of the Project

### Background
Louise is an up and coming playwright who wants to start a crowfunding campaign to fund her play, Fever. We are trying to help her by analyzing a dataset to determine if there are certain factors that make a campaign successful.

For the purpose of this analysis, we are using a Kickstarter dataset.

### Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever almost reached it's fundraising goal in a short time. The purpose of this analysis is to provide her with insights on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis Overview
There were two different analyses done. 

1. The first was to examine the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns with respect to the launch date of the campaign. Pivot tables and charts were used for this analysis and the pivot chart comparing campaign outcomes depending on start month of the campaign is shown below.

2. The second was to examine the outcome of Kickstart campaigns with respect to the campaign goal amount. Excel formulas were primarily used for this analysis and the line graph comparing campaign outcomes depending on goal ranges is shown below.
